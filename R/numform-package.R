#' Tools to Format Numbers for Publication
#'
#'Format numbers for publication; includes the removal of leading zeros,
#'standardization of number of digits, addition of affixes, and a p-value
#'formatter.  These tools combine the functionality of several 'base' functions
#'such as \code{\link[base]{paste}}, \code{\link[base]{format}}, and
#'\code{\link[base]{sprintf}} into specific use case functions that are named in
#'a way that is consistent with usage, making their names easy to remember and
#'easy to deploy.
